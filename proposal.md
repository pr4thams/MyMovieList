## **Selected Feature Elaboration**

- Title Length: It is a category to sort the search according to the number of episodes in a title.
- Watchlist/Add to Watchlist: It is a collection of all the saved titles. It will be displayed with different user defined themes (Watchlist themes) whereas add to watchlist would enable the user to add a title with a watch status, start date, end date and episodes watched.
- Notification Panel: It will contain the recent news/updates regarding the changes in the users watchlist. (And we are brainstorming on more content reagrding this feature.) 
- User Statistics: It will be a small UI on the home page and profile page (similar to GitHub statistics UI). It will contain user statistics regarding of all the episodes watched, mean rating of the ratings given by the user. (There are further minute features which would be added in future.)
- Watchlist Theme: User will have a option to customize their watchlist and personalize according to their own preference. they will have the ability to add images, make a background theme or choose from predefined themes. (We are aiming to make it something like Steam profile.)
